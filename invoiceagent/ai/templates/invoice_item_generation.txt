Work information to process:
{work_logs}

Guidelines for generating quality invoice items:

FOR STRUCTURED WORK LOGS:
1. Group similar activities into cohesive line items, even if performed on different days
2. Create clear, concise descriptions that communicate value to the client
3. Use the exact hours provided in the logs for accurate billing

FOR FREE-FORM DESCRIPTIONS:
1. Extract key information about tasks, hours, and dates (if mentioned)
2. Make reasonable inferences about time spent if hours aren't explicitly stated
3. Structure the information into professional invoice items
4. Note any significant uncertainties that might need client verification

GENERAL GUIDELINES:
1. Ensure descriptions are professional and appropriate for billing purposes
2. Preserve categories when they exist for consistency
3. Focus on deliverables and outcomes rather than technical details
4. Use industry-standard terminology that clients will understand
5. Maintain complete accuracy in hour calculations when hours are provided

Remember that these line items will appear directly on an invoice sent to the client, so they should be clear, professional, and justify the value of work performed.
