Guidelines for creating an effective invoice summary:

1. Provide context for the billing period and work performed
2. Highlight key accomplishments, deliverables, or milestones achieved
3. Connect the work to the client's business objectives when possible
4. Maintain a professional, concise tone appropriate for formal business communication
5. Focus on value delivered rather than listing individual tasks
6. Use terminology that resonates with the client's industry and priorities
7. Set the appropriate context for the detailed line items that follow

Remember that this summary will appear at the top of the invoice and is often the first thing a client reads, so it should effectively frame the value of your services while maintaining complete professionalism.
