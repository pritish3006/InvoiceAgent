## Implementation Order

1. **Foundation Phase** (Data Layer + Basic CLI) âœ…
2. **Core Functionality Phase** (AI Integration + Basic Invoice Generation) ðŸ”„
3. **User Experience Phase** (Full CLI + Template Refinement)
4. **Integration Phase** (System Integration + Documentation)

This breakdown ensures:
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Each task has a specific focus without overlapping responsibilities
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All aspects of the system are covered from data to UI to documentation
- **Progressive Development**: The implementation order builds incrementally on completed components
