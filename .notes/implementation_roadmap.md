- [ ] Implement intelligent invoice item generation
- [ ] Create test suite with sample data

## Phase 4: Refinement & Usability (Weeks 7-8)

### User Experience
- [ ] Refine CLI experience
- [ ] Add helper commands and shortcuts
- [ ] Implement batch operations for common tasks

### Backup System
- [ ] Implement automated backup as outlined in backup_strategy.md

## Initial Development Tasks

1. Set up project structure with:
   ```
   /invoiceagent
     /db              # Database models and migrations
     /cli             # Command-line interface
     /ai              # Ollama integration
     /templates       # Invoice templates
     /export          # PDF generation
     /utils           # Helper utilities
     /config          # Configuration management
   ```

2. Create initial database schema
3. Implement basic CLI for data entry
4. Set up Ollama with Llama 3.2 8B model
5. Test basic prompt engineering for invoice text generation
